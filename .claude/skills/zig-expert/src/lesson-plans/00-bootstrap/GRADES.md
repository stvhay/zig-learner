# 00-bootstrap: Run 3

## Scoring System

Each exercise is scored on three components (max 105, min 0):

| Component | Base | Adjustments |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Correctness** | 30 | -5 new mistake, -10 repeated (in SKILL.md) |
| **Quality** | — | A: +30, B: +20, C: +10, D: +0, F: -20 |
| **Efficiency** | — | 30% cost reduction = +40. Each 1% less: -1. Can go negative. |

**Lesson score:** `(avg_exercise_score / 100) × level_points`

| Level | Pts | Lessons |
|-------|-----|---------|
| 0 | 5 | 1–6 |
| 1 | 15 | 7–11, 14 |
| 2 | 30 | 12, 16 |
| 3 | 50 | 13, 15, 17 |

**Total pool: 330 pts.** 100 = expected score. 105 = ceiling.

**Baselines:** `baselines.json` — min(Run 1, Run 2) per lesson.

**Prior runs:** See `GRADES-run1.md` and `GRADES-run2.md`.

Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.
The purpose of our lives is to be happy.
Get busy living or get busy dying.
You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.
Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.
If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people or things.
Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game.
Money and success don't change people; they merely amplify what is already there.
Not how long, but how well you have lived is the main thing.
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.
